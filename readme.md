Issue Handling is done on Drupal.org:

This module adds better usability and some improvements to the Core Views module by providing some new features:

<ul>
  <li>Views format plugin: Flexible Table</li>
<li>Exposed Filter: Visible Column Selector</li>
<li>Exposed form style: Manual selection</li>
</ul>

With the flexible table and column selector plugins, the users can choose which columns they want to see or to hide. You can define different compositions of columns in a views table layout.

With the Manual Selection exposed filter plugin, the user can choose exposed filters from a select list. This way a view with a lot of exposed filters keeps to be clean and clear. You only choose the filters you need. Additionally, you can define filters which should be always visible:
